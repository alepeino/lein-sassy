# lein-sass
Use Sass with Clojure.

## Prerequisites
lein-sass uses JRuby, so you need to have Ruby installed. You probably already
do, though.

## Usage
Add the following to your `project.clj`, using your CSS folders as appropriate.
```clojure
:sass {:src "resources/app/stylesheets"
       :dst "resources/public/stylesheets"}
```

To compile files once, use `lein sass once`.

To watch files for changes, use `lein sass watch`.

## What to do if it doesn't work
If you have any trouble using lein-sass, especially if there are any Ruby
issues, please [open an issue](https://github.com/vladh/lein-sass/issues/new).
This helps me out a lot, as I can get feedback from people using various
platforms in order to make lein-sass better.

## To do
* Add Autoprefixer support.
* Add more integration tests.

## Credits and License
